# WeatherPage
A example of a responsive webpage that displays data from an weather api. I was also using it as a small project to learn Vue.js and practice other web technologies

To run locally, run 'npm i' in the folder and then 'node server.js' or view my hosted version at http://floating-depths-95271.herokuapp.com/
